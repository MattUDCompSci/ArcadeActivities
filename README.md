# Feed Zeke!

## Help Zeke travel from level to level to get his jump back.

## About

After finally getting his big contract, Zeke is finally willing
to come back and play for the Dallas Cowboys again! But all that
time away from the practice field has left Zeke a shell of his
former self.

In this game, you must guide Zeke through multiple levels in order
to help him get back in shape and regain his famous leaping skills.
Use the platforms in each level to progress to the right edge of the 
screen and get to the next level.

Collect footballs as you see them as they will add 10 points to your score.
But don't be touched by a defender otherwise you will lose 10 points.

Every third level, there will be a trivia question to help refresh Zeke's
memory of who he is. Click the correct answer to earn 50 points, but click
the wrong answer to lose 10 points.

Complete all 12 levels to get Zeke his leap back.
